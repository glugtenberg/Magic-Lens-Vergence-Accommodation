This is a prototype visual acuity-testing application made in Unity as part of the research presented here: 

[Effects of Eye Vergence and Accommodation on Interactions with Content on an AR Magic-lens Display and its Surroundings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10535764)

The application renders eye acuity symbols (Landolt C or Sloan letters) on two displays while being able to control their vergence distance and accommodation distance.
This requires stereoscopic rendering capabilities of the displays that are used, such as a 3D projector with shutter glasses.
